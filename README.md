## About myself
I'm Zakhar Pidporinov, Backend developer.  
My path in development began with university. In 2019, I enrolled in a bachelor's degree in computer science. (Details in the "Education" section).  

My goal is to gain knowledge and improve my skills. I plan to write several startups and want to get any knowledge that can be useful for this.

I am a communicative person, I value not only knowledge, improvement, but also a corporate culture with nice people.
For me, work should be a pleasant and comfortable place that allows you to develop, and pressing deadlines are met through joint efforts with colleagues, and then remembered with a smile on my face.

## My views on AI
I think AI is a great assistant in my work. An assistant cannot replace the work of a professional, but it helps to do it faster.
Modeling, building architecture, separating certain elements - this is what I do myself and do not trust this work to AI:
- I am a professional code designer.
- AI is an executor who is able to do all the routine work that needs to be tested.

In conclusion, my position allows me to do the work quickly and develop software with excellent performance, structure, and architecture.
